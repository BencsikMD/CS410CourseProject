## Free Topic

The goal was to classify news headlines and/or articles as either having positive or negative sentiment using the increase or decrease of the market price as the model's label.  

### Overview

The "Data Clean" notebook demonstrates the dataset clean up that was required before processing the datasets. This notebook is split into 3 parts.

The first part will clean text by removing a lot of misc. characters and punctuation that was found in most of the datasets, remove stop words, remove extra spaces, and lower the case of the characters. Then, a new file will be saved with `_clean` added to the end of the file name.

2. What is your free topic?
3. Your documented source code and main results.
    1. An overview of the function of the code (i.e., what it does and what it can be used for). 2) Documentation of how the software is implemented with sufficient detail so that others can have a basic understanding of your code for future extension or any further improvement. 3) Documentation of the usage of the software including either documentation of usages of APIs or detailed instructions on how to install and run a software, whichever is applicable. 
4. Self-evaluation.
    1. Have you completed what you have planned?
    2. Have you got the expected outcome?
    3. If not, discuss why.
5. A demo that shows your code can actually run and generate the desired results.
    - If there is a training process involved, you donâ€™t need to show that process during the demo. If your code takes too long to run, try to optimize it, or write some intermediate results (e.g. inverted index, trained model parameters, etc.) to disk beforehand.
