# CourseProject

1. My info
2. What is your free topic?
3. Your documented source code and main results.
4. Self-evaluation.
    1. Have you completed what you have planned?
    2. Have you got the expected outcome?
    3. If not, discuss why.
5. A demo that shows your code can actually run and generate the desired results.
    - If there is a training process involved, you donâ€™t need to show that process during the demo. If your code takes too long to run, try to optimize it, or write some intermediate results (e.g. inverted index, trained model parameters, etc.) to disk beforehand.
